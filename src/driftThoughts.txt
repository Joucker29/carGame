How i think drifting works:
    When you drive and turn there is a centrifical force that is aplyed to your car.
    The grip of the tiers lests you stick to the road and when the stickiness of your tiers is overcome by centrifical fore you go into a drift.
    When you break centrifical force overcomes the stickiness of your tiers easier.

Implemntation:
    Create variable for tire stickiness
    Create centrifical force. Centrifical force has to be dependant of acceleration and how much you turn.
    When you break the stickiness variable decreases? Not so sure how to implement this.

Final thoughts:
    There may be a easier way to implement this but this is what i came up with and that's what im gonna do.
